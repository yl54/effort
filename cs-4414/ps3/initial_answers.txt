how many tasks are running before the first request arrives?
- create a new webserver
- setup tcp listener
- run a thread for an infinite loop for listening to requests
- run another infinite loop to get enqueued requests

what are all the tasks that are involves in handling a request?
- get new safe references to the sender and reciever handlers
- increase the visitor count
- check the request for a split in ' '
- get the current working directory
- pick a page to respond to the user
    - respond immediately for counter, error and dynamic pages
    - enqueue a request for static file
- save the stream for the response later
- enqueue the request
- dequeue the request eventually
- respond with a static file later

if a series of requests, r1, r2, ..., rn arrives in order, what can you say about the order in which the server will respond to them?
- if its looking for a counter, error, or dynamic page, it will be in order
- it looks like everything is inourder at the moment
